# Overview

I created this to edit a database that contains plastic pollution among different countries.

The project pulls data from a csv file which I got from ourworlddata.com and creates tuples from it and inserts it into the SQL database.

I wrote this so that people can continue to add data entries to the amount of plastic being emitted by countries every year.

# Relational Database

I am using a local database created by the Enter.py file.

I created a table of 4 different rows. Entity, Code, Year, and Plastic Emitted, which is based off of the CSV file I downloaded.

# Development Environment

I used sqlite3, predownloaded by python when installed. It allows the access of a local data base that you can create.

I used the standard python library to help aid me in this project

# Future Work
I plan on...
* Bettering my knowledge on SQL and how to use the UPDATE command because it was kindof confusing!
* I want to make it so that you can use any CSV file and use it in this program
* I think that it would be cool to try and make this database accessable to computers across the LAN
